Configuring the compiler
By default the TypeScript compiler will print a help message when run in an empty project.

The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file.

You can have TypeScript create tsconfig.json with the recommended settings with:

npx tsc --init
Which should give you an output similar to:

Created a new tsconfig.json with:
TS
  target: es2016
  module: commonjs
  strict: true
  esModuleInterop: true
  skipLibCheck: true
  forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true

You can learn more at https://aka.ms/tsconfig.json
Here is an example of more things you could add to the tsconfig.json file:

{
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./build"
  }
}
You can open the file in an editor to add those options. 
This will configure the TypeScript compiler to transpile 
TypeScript files located in the src/ directory of your project, 
into JavaScript files in the build/ directory.

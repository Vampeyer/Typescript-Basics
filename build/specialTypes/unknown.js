// unknown is a similar, but safer alternative to any.
// TypeScript will prevent unknown
// types from being used, as shown in the below example:
// unknown is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. To add a type later, you'll need to cast it.
// Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say property or variable is of the casted type.

unknown is best used when you don't know the type of data being typed. 
To add a type later, you'll need to cast it.
Type: unknown
unknown is a similar, but safer alternative to any.

TypeScript will prevent unknown types from being used.



Casting is when we use the "as" keyword to say or declare that ,  that 
property or variable is of the casted type.
